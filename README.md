# Year-11-CS-Unit-1-Quiz-Variables


Ensure that you read all instructions carefully. Do not include any additional variables or methods that are not specified in this quiz description. Each question is worth one mark and is binary, except for question 16, which is worth 2 marks. That is, you either get 1 mark or 0 marks for each question, again, except for question 16. There are 16 questions on this quiz hence this quiz is worth 17 marks in total. The only application that is to be running on your computer is your IDE (until you are ready to submit your quiz). When you are ready to submit your quiz, please share it on github and ensure that all of your work has been pushed to your repository. Double check this by confirming that your completed classes exist in your repository on github. Submit the link to your repository on Schoology.

Good luck, have fun! :)

Inside the main method â€¦
1. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called age to a value of 16.
2. Declare and initialize a variable of type String called name to a value of Taylor.
3. Print out the variable age using a single println statement. 
4. Print out the variable name using the println statement.
5. Declare and initialize a variable of type String called description to a value of My name is Taylor and I am 16 years old. Make sure to use the variables age and name in this String. That is, you must use String concatenation. Do not hardcode the values Taylor and 16.
6. Print out the variable description using a single println statement. 
7. Declare and initialize a variable of type double called balance to a value of 18.89.
8. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called dollars. This variable should be equal to the value of casting the variable balance to an int. That is, if balance is equal to 18.89, dollars will therefore be equal to 18.
9. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called dollarsRounded. This variable should be equal to the value of casting the variable balance to an int but will round balance to the nearest integer. That is, if balance is equal to 18.89, dollarsRounded will therefore be equal to 19.
10. Declare and initialize a variable of type char called letter to a value of A.
11. Print out the variable letter.
12. Cast the variable letter to an integer and print it out. Do this in a single statement.
13. Increment the variable letter using the postfix increment operator.
14. Print out the variable letter.
15. Cast the variable letter to an integer and print it out. Do this in a single statement.
16. Explain what is happening in questions 10 - 14. Focus your explanation on character data types and integers.
